# Traffic Sign Classifcation
Traffic Signs are easy to identify for humans. However
for computer systems, its a challenging problem. Traffic Sign Classification is the process of automatically recognizing traffic signs along the road. 

In this project, the performance of different CNN architectures for Traffic sign classification is analyzed against datasets of varying classes and
samples. Effects of different hyperparameters on model performance and its convergence is also studied. The trained models are evaluated using different 
performance metrics and a comprehensive comparison report is being generated. Careful consideration was given on the choice of datasets for the study to 
make sure they can represent signs of varied variety and real-world distortions and weather conditions. All the models performed the best for dataset 2 among the
chosen 3 datasets. Moreover out of all the models best performance has been shown by ResNet-18 with 96.42% accuracy. Second and third best performing 
models being VGG11 and ResNet-18 with 95.11% and 91.78% respectively.

# 9 Models - 3 different architectures and 3 different Datasets

In this project we have created in total of 9 models: 3 Architecture and 3 different datasets on each architectures.

1. AlexNet
2. VGG-11
3. ResNet-18

**Reasoning for the choice of Architectures**

The rationale behind the choice of the architectures is that these are the runner-up/winners of the ILSVRC 2012, 2014 and 2015
and also the fact that these architectures casued the transition from traditional computer vision to deep learning based.
